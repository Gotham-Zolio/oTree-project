        <p>
            In this task, two participants are paired together: a <b>Sender</b> and a <b>Receiver</b>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>Sender</b> starts with <b>100 tokens</b> and decides how many to transfer to the Receiver.</li>
            <li>
                <span style="background-color: #fff3cd; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 4px;">
                    <b>🚀 The Multiplier:</b> Any amount transferred is <b>TRIPLED</b> before reaching the Receiver.
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>The <b>Receiver</b> then decides how much of the tripled amount to return to the Sender.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            You have been assigned the role of the <b>Sender</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must decide how much of your endowment to invest in the Receiver.
            The more you send, the more the total pot grows, but your earnings depend on how much the Receiver chooses to return.
        </p>
