            In the following section, you will participate in a series of <b>independent decision-making tasks</b> and complete corresponding questionnaires.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your decisions in these tasks will affect a <b>real monetary bonus</b> for both you (and possibly another anonymous human participant).

    <p>
        After all tasks are completed, the system will <b>randomly select one of them</b> to be the "task-for-payment."
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings you make in that selected task will be converted to real money and added to your base payment as a bonus.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">
        The conversion rate is: 20 tokens = $1 USD.

        <li>
            Because <b>any</b> of the tasks could be selected for real payment, it is in your best interest to treat each decision seriously.
        </li>
        <li>
            For each task, you will be anonymously paired with a <b>new, different, anonymous human participant</b>.
