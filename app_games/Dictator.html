            In this task, two participants are paired together: a <b>Sender</b> and a <b>Receiver</b>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>Sender</b> starts with an endowment of <b>100 tokens</b> and has complete control over how to split it.</li>
            <li>The <b>Receiver</b> has no power to reject. They simply accept whatever amount the Sender decides to give.</li>
        </ul>

            <b>🎲 Role Assignment (50/50 Chance)</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike the other tasks, your role has not been decided yet.
            The system will randomly assign your role <b>after</b> you make your decision.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>50% Chance:</b> You become the <b>Sender</b> (Your decision counts).</li>
            <li><b>50% Chance:</b> You become the <b>Receiver</b> (You get what the other person sent).</li>
        </ul>

    <b>Payment Note:</b>
    Because we do not know your role yet, please make your decision <b>assuming you are the Sender</b>.

    If the coin flip makes you the Sender, this decision will determine real payments for both you and your partner.
