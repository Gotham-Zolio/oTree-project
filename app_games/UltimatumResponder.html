            In this task, two participants are paired together: a <b>Proposer</b> and a <b>Responder</b>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>Proposer</b> receives an endowment of <b>100 tokens</b> and proposes how to split them between the two of you.</li>
            <li>The <b>Responder</b> reviews the offer and decides whether to <b>Accept</b> or <b>Reject</b> it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            You have been assigned the role of the <b>Responder</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You do not get to decide the split amount, but you have the final say on whether the deal goes through.
            <ul class="text-danger">
                <li><b>If you Accept:</b> The Proposer keeps their share, and you receive the offered amount.</li>
                <li><b>If you Reject:</b> The deal is cancelled. <b>Both you and the Proposer receive 0 tokens.</b></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
