<p>
Thank you for completing the study. Before you leave, there is one important detail about the research design that we need to disclose.
In the conversation task you just completed, you were informed that you would interact with a 'conversational partner'.
We want to clarify that your partner in this specific session was actually an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot, not a human participant.
</p>

<p>
Why did we withhold this information before? Previous research suggests that people often have pre-conceived biases or stereotypes about AI
(e.g., expecting them to be cold or robotic). If we had disclosed the AI's identity beforehand, it might have influenced your natural way of communicating
and prevented us from accurately measuring the true quality of the interaction. To understand how such interaction itself affects human decision-making,
it was scientifically necessary to create a scenario where the interaction could be experienced without the 'AI label' acting as a filter.
</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding!</p>
